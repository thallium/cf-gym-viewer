## CF GYM VIEWER

View code on Codeforces GYM without an admin account, inspired by [cf-code](https://github.com/dianhsu/cf-code). You can also use it with your own alt account so you don't have to enable admin mode on your main account.

Currently this uses cookie to fetch submission, login functionality is being implemented.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
